              I think that it’s crucial to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses to do any sort of career planning; it can also be extremely insightful to yourself to do so. So, in this section I will be doing just that.

              In my opinion my strengths give me a fairly good outlook at the film industry from the start. For example, I love working with people and I don’t find it too hard to be able to resolve personal issues with others. I also feel that I am not overbearing on people when in a leadership position; although this may, in cases, be a detriment in certain scenarios which I will talk about later.
              <br><br>
              I also love working on films; I have high-energy and am highly-motivated. I am of course an ameteur compared to well-seasoned professionals, however, I have had some experience with my own projects, as well as engaging highly with members of the course through all years and have shown some raw talent.

              I feel that my weaknesses will be hard to overcome in the short term; but I also feel that they are mainly related to my lack of intense practice in the art of film-making, and may be solved through simply engaging practically in the craft. For example, my inclination of being an ameteur may be cured through simply dedicating time to work more solely on the practical making of films. I am often afforded the chance to take extra initiative, but rarely step forward for it in fear of treading on others’ toes; but, in future, I think I should develop a more initiative-focused approach to my engagement in projects.
              <br><br>
              In terms of my assertiveness, the issue isn’t that i’m not assertive, but that I don’t fully understand the best instances in which to use my assertiveness, for example I felt that I have possibly been too lenient with people in the past, but have not really had a tight deadline in which to test my assertiveness. But again.

              Update 03/01/2021
              <br><br>
              I am beginning to resolve the issues I have in the lack of intense practical work, This past month I followed the advice to “Put yourself at risk of succeeding” and applied myself to practical work almost constantly. I took the opportunities that came my way to get on third year film shoots and built upon them to get on more and more shoots. In total I have so far worked on six graduate films this year, which is more than even some third years! I have also began working on second year projects. Overall the month was an intense learning experience and I am now content to begin work on my own small productions.

              Luckily I have had a lot of opportunities to enhance my contacts and practical experience and I think it’s important to capitalize on that. A guest speaker at college had told me to say ‘yes’ to any opportunities and develop professional relationships whilst I’m working. If lockdown restrictions begin to ease there will be a huge opportunity to advance as a lot of talented people have been cooped up in their dorms and would no doubt love to attach themselves to any project possible. It is just a matter of taking the initiative to capitalise on this opportunity if and when it presents itself, which may be later this academic year or at the beginning of the next.
              <br><br>
              I will also have a lot of free time over the summer to enthrall myself in my work and possibly get involved in some other productions if possible. Essentially, I believe that there will be a lot of opportunity around when lockdown eases, it is just recognizing these opportunities and taking initiative to capitalize on them.

              Update 03/01/2021
              <br><br>
              As the restrictions eased opportunities did arise which I capitalized on.

              I see very little in the way of threats apart from on the front of my own personality. I can sometimes become introverted and embarrassed when I don't need to be and can sometimes be shy to take initiative; I have recognised this though and am doing my best to fight it and slowly but surely fix these issues. Other than this there is obviously quite a lot of competition within the creative industry and I believe that I will need to specialise quickly to have a chance of surviving within the industry; so, I have set a goal to have decided on my specialisation by the first of June. So far I have looked at various routes and I'm really starting to get a feel for the route I want to go down, which is a good indication for me that I may very well have some hope of finding my specialisation, which will hopefully lead to a successful career.
              <br><br>
              Other than this I strangely see the university as a slight threat, being that they have seemed to be content on limiting our creative output even with restrictions easing, but i’m not sure how I should handle that.

              Goal - My end goal for my Three Year Plan is to be in a competent position that will enable me to work within an independent job role that will afford me the possibility of working anywhere in the world. Essentially, a job/business that does not rely on my exact location to be able to be conducted; which would allow me to travel. Currently, I am looking at both location-based traditional roles as well as more contemporary routes such as tabletop advertising and journalism. I hope to be decided on my exact role by the first of June.

              Learn and earn + build portfolio
              <br><br>
              I want to learn all of the skills necessary to achieve my goal of travel-based work. I have identified that I need a strong and specific portfolio to get into a role with my desired benefits and once I have decided on my exact role, I need to build up a few major skills. These include the basic employability skills identified by ‘YouthCentral.GOV’ but also skills such as intense organisation and admin capabilities; as this will help me arrange travel specifics and ensure everything I am doing is legal and a proper contract is in place. It is also important to network which I did heavily in April and May, taking advantage of opportunities to get on as many second and third year sets as available.
              <br><br>
              Whilst I am at university I will also build my portfolio. While I study I also want to earn money working within a part-time job role which will build my character, I am constantly putting my CV out there but unfortunately, there are little opportunities because of COVID-19. More recently I have been able to get work on student productions, however some of these were downsized due to an IT disruption which limited the university’s admin capabilities.

              Our huge summer breaks at university afford chances to work within the industry. During the summer breaks I want to do just this, either working with my current contacts or by myself; I am looking to create content which will help me specialise in the area which I will have decided on by the first of June. The content I make over the summer break will give me a small portfolio of work that will allow me to enhance my contacts within the industry and really flesh out the points of production where I am weakest; which will allow me to develop strategies to strengthen myself in those areas.

              Getting out of university I intend to use the skills I have honed to break into the industry. If I am successful, this work will allow me to travel to different countries whilst working. This will afford me the opportunity to see the world and expose myself to different cultures, which I’ve always wanted to do and would be happy to do for a good few years, at least if I am able to. I think it’s important not to stagnate though and I may book myself onto intensive courses and try and continue to learn from more knowledgeable individuals.
