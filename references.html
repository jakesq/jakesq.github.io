                        "As the project leader of my graduate film I brought Harry in as a still photographer/Covid Marshall. Harry did an excellent job on both those roles, his photography ability was particularly prevalent. Most of the crew have posted his photos across their personal social platforms. I also brought Harry on the project ‘Grounded’ that I was the 1st AD on, Harry once again showcased his keen interest and talent at photography. Harry actually got me onto the set of ‘Monotone’ where he was doing stills photography however he was promoted to the position of Camera Assistant on one of the filming days. Harry continues to keep himself working on big graduate projects such as ‘The Yellow Wallpaper’ and ‘What Happened to the Goldfish’. Harry’s impressive photography skills and extremely passionate work ethic will get him a long way in the industry. Harry is likely the most committed first year Filmmaker that I have met as he simply wants to be on every set that is happening at the university!"

                        It is my pleasure to recommend Harry Dunwoodie as a candidate for your production. 
                        I was lucky enough to have Harry on my set for the Graduate Film: “Tyrone’s Story” in April this year. Harry proved his worth very quickly and was keen to do his best at any task we gave him. In total we had four shoot days, Harry was present for all of them and was even able to allow us filming permission in his personal flat. Furthermore Harry took up the role of Covid martial, behind the scenes photographer and assisted with transportation. Harry did all of these jobs to the best of his ability with expert communication and precision. As a director I would happily hire Harry again for any of my upcoming productions. If you require any more additional information I would be happy to be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me on my email address: (email address redacted).
                        <br><br>
                        Yours sincerely
