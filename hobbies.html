                I, of course, love film and have been making a great effort to actively engage with my subject despite COVID-19, which has made learning and simply practicing film very hard. I found my route into engaging with my subject through stills photography, which got me ‘plugged’ into the local film production community and has been bringing me onto various sets to continue learning ‘on-the-job’ ever since. Of course, I could not discredit those that have been mentoring me through these productions and getting me on more sets, all of whom I owe my knowledge to and am extremely grateful for.

                    I have known for a while that I’ve wanted to travel and learn a new language. With a lot of forein-language-speaking friends, I have been encouraged to take up a new language. I have not been learning very long but practice about two hours a day with a friend that is tutoring me and have held some basic conversation for an extended period.

                    I have been encouraged to keep myself fit and am doing the best I can to take on that advice. I still don't eat the best, but have started regularly going to the gym and am cycling everyday. I am also looking into nutritional information so that I cani can develop a meal plan.
