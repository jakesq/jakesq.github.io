              This week I was actually able to get on-set with some third years because of the lockdown beginning to ease. I had replied to their request for a location that could be used as a council flat and offered up my student accommodation, since I was the only one there over the easter break. I also offered to help out their entire shoot as a Stills Photographer/COVID Marshall, luckily they agreed and let me help on their entire four-day shoot. This week’s entry is my account of what it’s like to be on-set and what I learnt from my experience. 
              <br><br>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">Day One - Studio Dance Sequence</span>
              <br><br>
              The first day was nerve racking, at least before I arrived. I didn't know what to expect and had never met any of these people before; furthermore, they were in the third year and were working with professionals, I on the other hand had no on-set experience. I had heard that this particular shoot day was going to be quite relaxed and so made it my goal to simply make a good first impression.
              <br><br>
              So, I made sure to arrive early, with all of my gear, fully charged and squared away. When everyone arrived I made sure to make a decent first impression by saying “hello” and helping out with heavy kit. Most of the day was pretty relaxed as we were pretty much only filming a small dance sequence, but I made sure to take advantage of that fact and talked to some cast and crew about their interests so that I could start developing some professional relationships, soon everyone started to warm up to me a bit and my initial nervousness dropped away. I also took full advantage of the lighting setup to grab some great pictures of almost all of the crew, of course I waited until it wasn’t being used and asked politely.
              <br><br>
              My lesson from the first day was that you should always make an effort to talk to people a bit if you’re not working on anything else, people are often happy to tell you about themselves and their interests and even teach you how some things work. It also helps them see you as not ‘just another runner’, which develops your personal contacts a bit. One crew member told me “To succeed in this business you need a good work ethic and a sociable personality” words to live by.
              <br><br>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">Day Two - Apartment Scenes</span>
              <br><br>
              The second day was all about my student accommodation, I kept this place pretty clean but made sure to have an extra special clean up simply for the day. I didn't want the crew to waste time cleaning up after me before the shoot or knocking over pots and pans still out on the drying rack. By the time I was done the place looked pretty good and the only cleaning crew had to do was antiviral spray over all doors and handles in the apartment. This bode well for me I reckon as it showed that I lived an orderly lifestyle, which, it seems is not the ordinary for someone living in student accommodation.
              <br><br>
              On this day I got pretty excited because this would be the first day all of the actors would be in the same room together. It made a change to see professionals working on characters rather than your mates that look like they regret agreeing to be in your film. These guys had studied the script and embodied their characters fully, breathing life into what were essentially just words on a page. They would be their character one minute and then “cut” would be called and they would go back to being themselves in an instance. This got me really excited about being able to work with professional actors of my own in the second year. On the other hand however it was a little daunting, these guys really dug into every word and could easily spot mistakes or lazy writing (not that there was any in this particular production) so my script for the second year would have to be on-point to even be considered by a professional actor.
              <br><br>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">Day Three - Gang Fight Scene</span>
              <br><br>
              Okay so I was quite excited for the third day, it was meant to mainly be a gang fight scene that a professional stunt coordinator was coming in to help with. He had worked on anything from small budget productions to the biggest budget films and it was honestly surprising to see him drive all the way from Cardiff to do a whole day's work for no pay. The day was pretty good and I got some great pictures of the cast, crew and myself. Although, the fight scene ended up taking all day to shoot, partially because the stunt coordinator had such great suggestions on how the scene could be changed. This made my day quite tiring because half of the time I was dealing with keeping the public from walking across the set, which about one in ten were really eager to do; I guess a lot of people don't like being told what to do by a uni-student in a luminous jacket.
              <br><br>
              Lesson is, always anticipate things will take longer than you think they will and don’t underestimate the power of public stubbornness. 
              <br><br>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">Day Four - Jacob’s Ladder and Gym 01</span>
              <br><br>
              Today was the last day of shooting and it was going to be long since we had overrun the previous day and so had to cram the scene we’d missed alongside two other scenes. Again I had to deal with the public but fortunately not much in the afternoon when I was tired and less willing to put up with some of their disagreeableness. Despite the fact that we had to shoot three separate scenes, none of them were too long and were much less complicated then the previous day’s fight scene.
              <br><br>
              We did however have issues filming on the bridge over the train tracks ‘Jacob’s Ladder’, as there was construction work going on over the tracks. The sound caused by the workers was disruptive but they gave us a thirty minute window when they had their lunch-break to stop rehearsing and get the shots we needed, although this half an hour had to be negotiated with the site manager. The public had also been quite co-operative apart from a few very rude individuals.
              <br><br>
              It was great to see everything moving as smoothly as it did, I think time-constraints made people more focused and productive; I had heard this referred to as ‘Parkinson’s Law’. When we wrapped everyone was clearly very tired, unfortunately we couldn’t go and sit at the pub together, as I feel that would have been good for everyone, but we did all have a good chat and exchanged social media.
              <br><br>
              From the third day I learnt that it’s important to set deadlines during filming and stick to them. You should also make sure that your locations are scouted properly, making sure that there’s no construction work to be heard in the area and preferably go at times when foot-traffic is limited. I also think it’s good to have a cool down period after wrapping where everyone can casually hat, whether on-set or at the pub for a short while after.
              <br><br>
              I had a great time with excellent people through the week and learnt a lot. I think I need to get on-set a lot more, because it’s really easy to learn from things other people have overlooked, as well as the people themselves. One thing I’ll remember is to have walkie-talkies, which let the runners know when to let people through without them having to guess or be shouted at from a distance. This can be especially troublesome in the middle of the day when there’s a lot of white noise.

              Blind House - Stills Photographer Runner (19th of April - 21st of April)
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="horizontalContent">
            <div class="blindhouseImage"></div>
            <p class="contenttext">
              This week I was involved in another graduate film which was a short horror movie called Blind House.
              <br><br>
              These guys were great to learn from as they undertook quite a hard genre and were using a professionally soured location, which happened to be the most haunted place in the UK.
              <br><br>
              I felt like I learnt a lot this week, two main things above all:
              <br><br>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">Networking is about finding the right moments to talk to people</span>
              <br><br>
              I had always known that people like talking about themselves, but I didn’t realise just how true this was. I took the opportunities that presented themselves to talk one-on-one to all of the crew members on set and even the actors; this was only possible during the shoot for small segments between camera setups, apart from at lunch where more time was afforded to talk through pieces of equipment and crew members’ general tips and tricks. 
              <br><br>
              People appreciated that I wanted to learn and the fact that I took an interest in them, we might then engage on a personal level and then exchange contact information. This worked best when someone needed to grab lunch or pop off to the shops; I’d simply ask to join them and then talk to them on the drive/walk.
              <br><br>
              <span style="font-weight: 700">All sets are different</span> 
              <br><br>
              I felt that the Blind House set was a lot different to the set of Tyrone’s Story, which had been intense with long days and shorter breaks. Blind house, in contrast, had been much more relaxed, there were still long days but scenes had not needed to be as intense as some of Tyrone’s Story’s, such as the fight scene which took an entire day to film with constant work and collaboration from a professional stunt coordinator. This has given me the impression that sets can be very different from each other, I should always be ready for an intense day but I might not find that they always are.
              <br><br>
              <span style="font-style: italic">Update 30th April</span>
              <br><br>
              Sets are definitely not all the same, I was just on a second year documentary that was even more relaxed than my college projects. Everything was still, of course, professional, but the shoot was extremely relaxed.

              This week I was on a really great set for a film called mono line about a women’s story that suffers with tinnitus.
              <br><br>
              I got a ‘field promotion’ whilst on my first day to 2nd Assistant Camera as I had shown my knowledge of aspects of film to the DOP and had a pleasant experience with all of the crew. I took up this role for the rest of the week and even acted as 1st AC for a day when the actual 1st AC had to step out for the day. On top of this the crew were nice enough to show me around the FS7 camera and the 663 Audio mixer as well as let me boom operate for a scene or two. I had an intensely pleasant experience with all of this crew and did some great networking. They also worked with some professional actors, the lead actress was the best I’d seen yet and the direction from the director had been key to unleashing that. All in all quite a similar experience to when I worked on Tyrone’s story but the shoot dates were a little more relaxed.
              <br><br>
              Apart from the technical, from this I have learnt that you should talk to people about their individual job role and get them to show you some of the technical stuff. This helps you network as well as learn; you won’t get to know everything about their role or technical knowledge, but you will have a much more rounded general knowledge, which I’ve found helps communication when team-working.
              <br><br>
              <span style="font-weight:700">Off set</span>
              <br><br>
              I was given a break to meet some of the blokes from What Happened to the Goldfish? so I could essentially interview for a position on their set. We ended up in Eldon Building where The Yellow Wallpaper was being filmed, with what I had learnt about ‘putting yourself at risk of succeeding’  I went into the studio to ask the producer about helping out and she very politely agreed to let me.

              I worked for a day on grounded during their shoot in The White Swan studio. I was lucky enough to get the gig from a contact in third year that invited me to come down to the set to take some BTS photos for them. 
              <br><br>
              I got a few cool photos and it was interesting to see how the studio worked, but there were some very difficult and frustrating people. I’ve encountered people like this before and know how to deal with them, but I hadn’t encountered anyone like this on-set before. Unfortunately they made my job more difficult to do but I still did my best and was thanked by the director for coming and helping out. Overall it was quite a fun day and I even made a couple of good mates but unfortunately I encountered some unpleasant people, but luckily they seem to be few and far between.

              I was 1st AC on this film for two of their shoot days where I met lots of talented people that had great ways of solving problems and I learnt a lot more about the FS7 and using the LEDs. I also realised just how connected everyone is at the university, half the people I met turned out to live with a mate from Tyrone’s story and some of the crew already knew who I was as someone on the course had told them about myself; it was relieving to hear that they had spoken positively about me.

              <span style="font-style: italic">Update 1/5/2021</span>
              <br><br>
              The film industry is way more connected than I had realised. After working on The Yellow Wallpaper the AD revealed that he knew my close friend from primary school (one class per year) since they’d been on a shoot together.

              As part of a second year’s project I assisted in the making of their documentary project after I had had a pleasurable experience on set with one of their crew. It was overall a pleasant experience and I learnt about the C-300 and some tricks with it. It was also nice to talk to some more people in the second year, overall I had mostly talked to third years which was great! But then they’ll graduate within the next month or so and so won’t be around next year.
              <br><br>
              One of the best bits was the day before the shoot, I had been told that they could do with a sound guy, a driver, a stills photographer and a few more contributors; all of which I was able to source within an hour. This was thanks to the relationships I had built over the previous weeks. It felt good that my networking was already paying off and the people which I had sourced were all happy to get some more credits or videos of them skating.

              I was on the set of The Yellow Wallpaper for the day, it was the first full on studio shoot I’d been on, they had actually built a set that looked pretty impressive, it was a period piece and so everything they used had to be of the time and expertly put together. Here I got some experience with the Arri Alexa camera and developed a few more contacts.
              <br><br>
              I realised just how connected the industry was when the AD revealed that he knew someone from my primary school, a small school with one class per year. Everyone in the industry seems to know each other, which has made me even more alert to be attentive in shoots. It also relaxed me however as I’ve been getting good feedback from people on other sets, so hopefully if people hear about me it’ll only be good things.

            <p class="contenttext">
              I was luckily invited to another set, this time it was a second year’s Cinematography Film, ‘Auguries of Innocence’. I had stayed in contact with him since we had worked together before on Tyrone’s Story when he had shown me the basics of the ‘TASCAM Mark 2’. By pure coincidence I had already met the other students that I was working with, which helped me again realise just how connected everyone was. 
              <br><br>
              The shoot itself was a great one to learn more about lighting; it seemed to me that they had spent a lot of time planning their lighting and it had paid off from what I could see from the rushes. Although meticulously planned, I was given the chance to experiment with lighting, which made the subject altogether seem much less daunting than I had originally thought it was.
              <br><br>
              Since it was a relatively small set, I was able to provide a much more prominent role then in my past roles. Because I also had more practical experience, I was able to express realistic and sensible solutions to problems sometimes on the spot; not all of my suggestions were taken on but I believe the few that were taken were appreciated and were helpful. I had actually surprised myself by the pace at which I could do this, perhaps I had been learning more than I realised.
              <br><br>
              I also had a great chance to step up when we fell behind schedule, we were running out of time quickly and it didn’t look like there would be another day that their actress could do before their deadline. I stepped up in the panic and told them that they had a certain amount of time to get each shot, and if they weren’t as strict on their lighting and we were fast, then they would at least have the shots to complete the project with, then they could try and arrange another set day with the actress later on. From then on I kept time. We managed to finish the project with some time to spare, the shots weren't as good as our first ones that we’d had more time for, but they weren’t bad either.
              <br><br>
              At this point, I quite like the idea of becoming an Assistant Director, I think I could aim for that in some productions. I think that I’ve learnt a lot about ADing from being on set and I feel like I’d like to try it out as my main on-set role, at least for productions that are not my own. I no doubt have a lot to learn, but I know I can do more than just running now. I feel that I have made a decent impression on my recent contacts and I think they would be willing to give me a chance.

              When working on Auguries of Innocence, I had been asked if I could do sound for another shoot ‘Dry Bones’ happening the next day. I was unsure if I should and I needed to think about it, afterall, I didn’t want to mess up the sound on someone else’s set. But it was an opportunity I had to take; tackling sound would be my first major role on a set. So I accepted and the next day was holding the ‘TASCAM Mark 2’, I had basically not been taught to use this by the university, and relied on gained knowledge from what I had been shown on set; I was no doubtedly a little nervous, but pressed on. I made sure to arrive early, as usual, so that I could get hold of the kit and get it sorted out before the shoot properly started. It wasn’t too bad to set up and start with, the people I had talked to before about sound had been right when they said it was mostly just ‘point and shoot’, at least for my level of expertise.
              <br><br>
              The shoot itself was a relatively simple one, it was the smallest I had been on at three people including me! But I saw this as an opportunity to get more experience working with people at a more individual level as well as a chance to step up if there were issues. The shoot day went well in the end I think and I was given a nice bit of thanks for coming on such short notice which was nice to hear, but I told them that they’d done me a favour by giving me my first major role. There had been a few technical issues but I was told not to worry as they weren’t being marked on sound anyway. Coming away from the day I felt that I’d learned a lot and that I was beginning to get somewhere good with my networking, I just have to keep it up now.
